1. For the give JSON data iterate over all for loops(for, for in, for of, forEach).

// Sample JSON data representing a list of products
const productsData = [
  {
    "id": 1,
    "name": "Product A",
    "price": 29.99,
    "category": "Electronics"
  },
  {
    "id": 2,
    "name": "Product B",
    "price": 19.99,
    "category": "Clothing"
  },
  {
    "id": 3,
    "name": "Product C",
    "price": 9.99,
    "category": "Books"
  }
];



// Using for loop to iterate over the array
console.log("Using for loop:");
for (let i = 0; i < productsData.length; i++) {
  console.log(productsData[i]);
}




// Using for...in loop to iterate over object properties (not recommended for arrays)
console.log("\nUsing for...in loop:");
for (const key in productsData) {
  console.log(productsData[key]);
}




// Using for...of loop to iterate over the array
console.log("\nUsing for...of loop:");
for (const product of productsData) {
  console.log(product);
}



// Using forEach loop to iterate over the array
console.log("\nUsing forEach loop:");
productsData.forEach(product => {
  console.log(product);
});







2. Create your own resume data in JSON format.
